# A Basic Image Editor (imgeditor)

A NetBeans plug-in delivering basic image editor functionality.

It will read all basic images that are supported by the Netbeans image mime type and
save these as .png, .jpg, .gif and .bmp files.

Initial image manipulations include:

*  Image scaling (up or down)

*  Image cropping (rectangular)

*  Image Set creation - for creation of a set of images referenced in a srcset attribute on a
html img tag. An image can be scaled down using a set of rules
to create a suitable set of images for use with the srcset.
